A Short Intro And A Step-by-Step Guide to Build Your Own.Maximilian VogelFollow8 min read·Dec 28, 20242.7K70ListenShareMoreThe next big thing? Gartner believes AI agents are the future. OpenAI, Nvidia and Microsoft are betting on it — as are companies such as Salesforce, which have so far been rather inconspicuous in the field of AI.And there’s no doubt that the thing is really taking off right now.Press enter or click to view image in full size„AI Agents“ on Google Trends (trends.google.com)Wow.So, what is really behind the trend? The key to understanding agents is agency.Unlike traditional generative AI systems, agents don’t just respond to user input. Instead, they can process a complex problem such as an insurance claim from start to finish. This includes understanding the text, images and PDFs of the claim, retrieving information from the customer database, comparing the case with the insurance terms and conditions, asking the customer questions and waiting for their response — even if it takes days — without losing context.The agents do this autonomously — without humans having to check whether the AI is processing everything correctly.How I Got a Big AI Agent Up and Running — What Worked and What Didn’t.We went live in September last year with a logistics AI agent that autonomously retrieves lost shipments in…medium.comThe Espresso Machine and the BaristaIn contrast to existing AI systems and all the copilots out there that help employees to do their job, AI agents are, in fact, fully-fledged employees themselves, offering immense potential for process automation.Imagine — an AI that can take on complex, multi-step tasks that are currently performed by a human employee or an entire department:Planning, designing, executing, measuring, and optimizing a marketing campaignLocate a lost shipment in logistics by communicating with carriers, customers, and warehouses — or, if it remains lost, claim its value from the responsible partner.Search the trademark database each day and determine whether a new trademark has been registered that conflicts with my own trademark and immediately file an oppositiongather the relevant data or ask employees, check the data and compile an ESG reportCurrently, AI models can assist with tasks like generating campaign content or evaluating emails, but they lack the ability to execute an entire process.

Image credit: Maximilian VogelWhile traditional models are like great espresso machines, agent-based AI is the barista. Not only can they make coffee, but they can welcome the guests, take the order, serve the coffee, collect the money, put the cups in the dishwasher, and even close up shop at night. Even the best espresso machine in the world can’t run a café by itself, but the barista can.Why can the AI agent and the barista do this? They excel at mastering various subprocesses of a complex job and can independently decide which task to tackle next. They can communicate with people, like the clients, if they need more information (milk or oat milk?). They can decide who they should ask in case of problems (beans are out => boss, coffee machine is on strike => customer service of the machine vendor).Press enter or click to view image in full sizeAI agents vs. traditional generative AI.

Let us have a look at the relevant processes and workflows.Let us build an agent for the insurance process shown in the diagram above. The agent should handle an insurance claim from start to reimbursement.What we are developing here is the business architecture and the process flow. Unfortunately, I can’t dive into the coding because it can quickly become very extensive.1. Classification & sending a job into processing lanesOur workflow starts, when a customer sends a message with a claim for their home insurance to the insurer.What does our agent do? It determines what the customer wants by analyzing the message’s content.Based on this classification, the system initiates a processing lane. Often, this goes beyond function calling; it involves making a fundamental decision about the process, followed by executing many discrete steps.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeAI Agents: 1. Classify a mail and routing into different processing lanes. Image credit: Maximilian Vogel2. Extracting dataIn the next step, data is extracted. One of the main tasks of an agent is to turn unstructured data into structured data … to make processing systematic, safe and secure.Classification assigns a text to a predefined category, whereas extraction involves reading and interpreting data from the text. However, a language model doesn’t directly copy data from the input prompt; instead, it generates a response. This allows for data formatting, such as converting a phone number from ‘(718) 123–45678’ to ‘+1 718 123 45678’.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeAI Agents: 2. Extract data from the mail and attachments. Image credit: Maximilian VogelThe extraction of data is not limited to text content (from the e-mail text), but can also comprise data from images, PDFs or other documents. We use more than one model for that: LLMs, image recognition models, OCR and others. The above process is simplified, really massively simplified. In reality, we often send images to OCR systems that extract text from scanned invoices or forms.. And often we classify attachments as well, before analyzing them.We enforce JSON as the model’s output format to ensure structured data.This is the email input — unstructured data:Hi,I would like to report a damage and ask you to compensate me.Yesterday, while playing with a friend, my 9-year-old son Rajad kicked a soccer ball against the chandelier in the living room, which then broke from its holder and fell onto the floor and shattered (it was made of glass). Luckily no one is injured, but the chandelier is damaged beyond repair. Attached is an invoice and some images of the destroyed chandelier.Deepak Jamalcontract no: HC12-223873923123 Main Street10008 New York City(718) 123 45678This is the model output — a JSON, structured data:{"name":"Deepak","surname":"Jamal","address":"123 Main Street, 10008 New York City, NY","phone":"+1 718 123 45678","contract_no":"HC12-223873923","claim_description":"Yesterday [Dec-8, 2024], while playing with a friend, my 9-year-old son Rajad kicked a soccer ball against the chandelier in the living room, which then broke from its holder and fell onto the floor and shattered (it was made of glass).\nLuckily no one is injured, but the chandelier is damaged beyond repair.\n"}3. Calling external services, making the context persistentMany generative AI systems can answer queries directly — sometimes using pre-trained data, fine-tuning, or Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) on some documents. This is not enough for agents. Almost every reasonably powerful AI agent needs to access corporate or external data from databases.To keep the context of a process persistent beyond the current session, it must also write data to systems and databases. In our case, the agent checks the contract number against a customer database and writes the status of the claim to an issue tracking system. It can also — remember: agency! — request missing data from external parties, such as the customer.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeAI Agents: 3. Call external services and make the context persistent. Image credit: Maximilian Vogel4. Assessment, RAG, reasoning and confidenceThe heart of every administration job consists of interpreting incoming cases in relation to various rules. AI is particularly good at this. Because we can’t provide all contextual information (e.g., policy content or terms and conditions) when calling a model, we use a vector database to retrieve relevant snippets — a technique known as RAG.And we prompt the AI to ‘think aloud’ before making an assessment. Thinking before blurting out the result improves answer quality — something we’ve all learned since 3rd grade math. We can also use the output of the model reasoning in many obvious and less obvious ways:- To substantiate an answer to the customer- To help the prompt engineer and data scientist figure out why the model made a mistake- For checks: Did the model arrive at the correct answer by chance, or can we see through its reasoning that the solution was inevitable?Here’s a little cheat sheet on reasoning and other prompt engineering techniques.Confidence is the key to maximizing accuracy. If the model estimates its confidence — and, dear prompt engineers, this also requires very good few shot learning examples for various confidence values — then we can configure the system to operate with extreme safety or high automation: We set a threshold of confidence below which all cases should go to human support. A high threshold ensures minimal errors but requires more manual processing, while a lower threshold allows more cases to be processed automatically, albeit with an increased risk of errors.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeAI Agents: 4. Use RAG / reasoning / confidence to obtain reliable assessments. Image credit: Maximilian VogelEt voila! If you have just implemented 2 or 3 of the above steps, you have developed an agent. I’ve outlined only the key components of these AI agents. You can certainly imagine the others. And you can either implement it with help of frameworks such as crewAI, langGraph, langFlow and their siblings or just do it in pure Python.Remarkably, such a system can automate 70%–90% of a claims management department’s workload. And that’s not possible with simple pre-agent generative AI systems. Two years ago, I could never have imagined this becoming reality so quickly.tl;dr?
